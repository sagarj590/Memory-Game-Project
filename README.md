# Memory-Game-Project
The game was built as a part of my Nano-Degree program. The purpose of the project is to make a memory game using event listeners, functions and loops which shuffles card at random and is intended for the concentration improvement and testing visual memory of the player.  Special Features of this game are that it has a timer for keeping count of time, a star rating system, pop-up appearing that the player has won the game with his results and wether he wants to restart the game or not. The app is responsive for different screen sizes. How to play: 1)The game board consists of 16 cards arranged randomly in a grid. 2)The deck is made up of 8 pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. 3)The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol. 4)The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the card with the same symbol. 5)If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over. 6)If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state. 7)The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
